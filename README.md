# escalama-action
experimenting with github actions. 

## Idea

Track technical dept across multiple commits and escalate them:
- on introduction, create an issue somehow
- after several commits, raise warnings
- after x commits, raise exception until dept is removed

Requirements:

- how/where to create issue?
- how store data for tracking
